Study Area and Purpose: 

Ports are interesting because they need to balance economic activity with environmental damage mitigation and the health impact on disproportionately underrepresented communities. The Port of Long Beach stands as a leader in transforming its operations into a green port with the goal of being emission-free by 2035. They are by far the leader in the adoption of clean technologies and operational and community initiatives to reduce air pollution and improve stakeholder engagement. As a graduate student at USC Spatial Sciences Institute in the MS program in Human Security and Geospatial Intelligence, I am building upon my MA in Urban Planning and a GIST Certificate. As such, I find these types of land use projects to be of interest with the goal of helping others to see these challenges and understand how they can participate in supporting dialogue and funding. It was a welcome opportunity to bring this story to life with Photorealistic 3D Tiles powered by Cesium. 


Regarding the Jupyter Notebooks: 
Start with Data_Join then Move to Data Exploration and finally CreatePoints_Polygons
Additionally, you will find a Google Air Quality API in AirQuality_API. 
ExportGEOJSON is code used to create GEOJSON and KML Files from Data Layers. 

An air pollution for cancer risk data layer can also be found at: https://uscssi.maps.arcgis.com/home/item.html?id=617e29a115df455d99296b15029a0996

This project had 3 objectives. 
 1) Meet the workflow and learning objectives for 586-Project 5.
 2) Make a project that would meet the submission guidelines for the Google Immersive Geospatial Challenge
 3) Make a project that is part of the Cesium Certified Developer path that I can finalize and submit based on the foundational work done here. 

To see an adjacent project: project.philippaburgess.com which was created using Cesium Stories and hosted on GitHub Pages.
The final project will be hosted at cesium.philippaburgess.com when it is completed with the data frame and integrated layers.

On November 20th I submitted a version of this project without the data layers.
