# Port of Long Beach: Sustainability Analysis 

For 586 - 

This is Project 5. 

Regarding the Jupyter Notebooks: 
Start with Data_Join then Move to Data Exploration and finally CreatePoints_Polygons
Additionally, you will find a Google Air Quality API in AirQuality_API. 
ExportGEOJSON is code used to create GEOJSON and KML Files from Data Layers. 

An air pollution for cancer risk data layer can also be found at: https://uscssi.maps.arcgis.com/home/item.html?id=617e29a115df455d99296b15029a0996

This project had 3 objectives. 
 1) Meet the workflow and learning objectives for 586-Project 5.
 2) Make a project that would meet the submission guidelines for the Google Immersive Geospatial Challenge
 3) Make a project that is part of the Cesium Certified Developer path that I can finalize and submit based on the foundational work done here. 

**To see an adjacent project: project.philippaburgess.com which was created using Cesium Stories and hosted on GitHub Pages. **
The final project will be hosted at cesium.philippaburgess.com when it is completed with the data frame and integrated layers.
