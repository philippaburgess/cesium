Study Area and Purpose: 

Ports are interesting because they need to balance economic activity with environmental damage mitigation and the health impact on disproportionately underrepresented communities. The Port of Long Beach stands as a leader in transforming its operations into a green port with the goal of being emission-free by 2035. They are by far the leader in the adoption of clean technologies and operational and community initiatives to reduce air pollution and improve stakeholder engagement. As a graduate student at USC Spatial Sciences Institute in the MS program in Human Security and Geospatial Intelligence, I am building upon my MA in Urban Planning and a GIST Certificate. As such, I find these types of land use projects to be of interest with the goal of helping others to see these challenges and understand how they can participate in supporting dialogue and funding. It was a welcome opportunity to bring this story to life with Photorealistic 3D Tiles powered by Cesium. 

Build Options and Methodology: 

Cesium offers a number of options for getting started. Cesium Stories is an easy way to access the potential and although I started the project with custom coding, I ended up using this very straightforward application as part of the final deliverable. I tried to launch the Photorealistic 3D Tiles from within Google Cloud, but am not yet familiar enough with that platform to be able to successfully launch a Web App from within it (but I tried!) and aim to engage with Google Cloud Skills Boost to learn how to do this. I equally tried to write the custom code based on the Cesium instructions in VSCode but encountered an error. With the support of the Cesium Community Forum, I was able to resolve that issue. In the meantime, I'd moved over to the ArcGIS Pro and Cesium JS tutorials and they led me to Code Pen, where I did a simple fly-around to a few different locations in the port to demonstrate the custom code. 

Support and Mid-Steps:

I was able to bring this project into my final assignment for my GIS Programming and Customization course. As part of that process, we were working with ArcGIS Notebooks and I was able to find and transform data to use in my analysis. I researched the port through many articles, websites, and some webinars to find the talking points I wanted to include. Furthermore, I took the opportunity to enter an earlier version of this project into the Google Immersive Geospatial Challenge. That entry is at philippa.burgess.com. I am one of 7 entries into the Virtual Immersive Experience and Sustainability Category. It was the choice to pick a category and my selection of "sustainable" led to identifying the Port of Long Beach: Sustainability Analysis as my overall project.

Additional Tools: 

I hosted the web app on GitHub Pages. I used ChatGPT 4.0 and NotebookLM to help with research and coding. I used all of the Cesium tutorials as well as those related to ArcGIS Pro and CesiumJS.

Results: 

The final result offers a brief introduction to the port through text, an immersive experience, and additional graphics. It aims to give someone new information they might not have known about before. The Code Pen version demonstrates custom coding that is able to fly from location to location within the narrative scene. 

Challenges: 

Beyond the challenges of getting some of my code to load correctly, or figuring out the Google Cloud environment, I didn't want to download ArcGIS Pro 3.2 until after our main assignment for my graduate school course was delivered. I had a lot of trial and error in terms of taking feature layers I'd visualized in ArcGIS Pro and learning how they would translate into GeoJSON. Many of my layers had multiple points that just popped up in an overabundance of blue boxes. I thought about selecting a few to add interaction to port activities but the stand-alone table I created to do this would not convert to a layer to allow me to do this. I also found that polygons lacked detail. Once I started to better understand how it worked, as well as its limitations, I could better consider what data layers would be the most useful and attractive. Just to demonstrate an ability to add data layers, I settled on a polygon of Los Angeles County. 

Discussion: 

I feel like it has taken me a few weeks to really get comfortable with Cesium Ion and CesiumJS, but now that I have, I see unlimited potential. I am really interested in seeing how it works with Unity and Unreal Engine, as well as going further with Google Cloud so that I can gain the skills to launch a web app using the Photorealistic 3D Tiles from within Google. I feel like this project serves as just a beginning to demonstrate that I've learned how to write the code and get an application using Cesium up and running and include custom layers in it.
